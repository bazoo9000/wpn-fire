# wpnFire
Welcome to wpnFire, a game made in unity!
This is a port to desktop of a browser game that I used to love when i was a kid, in the quest to learn game development and how to develop a game (in Unity).
The game is about a stick man trying to survive waves of enemies for as long as it can using an arsenal of weapons.
The only differences are that it ain't in the browser anymore, remade the tutorial, written in C# instead of Flash and 30FPS converted to 60FPS (or maybe unccaped).
